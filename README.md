# Market-Basket-Analysis

The objective of this project was to find the buying behaviour of the customers of Instacart. The lift, confidence and support for items are studied over the entire period of 2 years, followed by the change in shopping behaviour of the customers based on weekends and weekdays as well as the behaviour of the customers on a half-yearly basis.
These insights will allow for a better understanding of customers buying behaviours as well as items which should be discounted more or customers who can be given special discounts to increase sales of the e-commerce organization.
The project has been completed using python language on Google Colab notebook.
Market Basket Analysis, Apriori, association rules and other techniques have been used to draw insights from the data.
